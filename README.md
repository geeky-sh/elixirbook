# Processcount

## Description

This project contains the ex files corresponding to learning [Programming Elixir](https://www.amazon.in/Programming-Elixir-1-3-Dave-Thomas/dp/168050200X?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=16dcf6d1-7c11-44f1-b748-a3bb8441730b) by Dave Thomas. I haven't curated the list from the initial chapters. The projects contains the learning starting from Part 2 - Concurrent Programming


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `processcount` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:processcount, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/processcount](https://hexdocs.pm/processcount).
